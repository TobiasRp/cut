# cut: C++ and CUDA utilities

Some commonly used code for working in C++ and CUDA. This is a collection of code that I found myself reusing a lot. It is not a production ready library.

Despite its name, a lot of functionality can be used with and without CUDA.

### Status

This library is still **work in progress** since I am still in the process of factoring out some useful code. As such, this is **not** optimized and polished ready-for-use code.

### Usage

When using modern cmake, you can directly use this project by adding it as a _subdirectory_.
