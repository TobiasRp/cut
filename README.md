# cut: CUDA utilities

Some commonly used code for working in C++.

Despite its name, most functionality can be used with and without CUDA.

### Status

This library is still **work in progress** since I am still in the process of factoring out some useful code. As such, this is **not** optimized and polished ready-for-use code.

### Usage

When using modern cmake, you can add directly use this project by adding it as a _subdirectory_.
